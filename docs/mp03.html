<p>A music playlist can make or break the mood at a party or even just a person’s individual mood. The right playlist can help set the mood or vibe for any occasion. There is no better feeling than when you have a playlist where bop after bop comes on and absolutely no skips. However, one wrong song can completely switch up the vibe — and not for the better.</p>
<p>Using the Spotify Song Analytics dataset, as well as the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset, I have set out to curate the ultimate playlist for good vibes this spring. This playlist will make you want to roll down the windows as you drive or just have a good time. It’ll help set the ultimate good vibes for the upcoming warmer seasons.</p>
<section id="getting-the-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-the-data"><strong>Getting the Data</strong></h2>
<p>In order to begin curating a playlist for good vibes this spring, I started by downloading the Spotify Song Analytics dataset from user gabminamendez on GitHub and processing it. This included reformatting the data so that each artist had their own line in the dataset. An example of the first few rows of that dataset can be seen below.</p>

<p><br> Next, I downloaded and processed the Spotify Million Playlist dataset and reshaped the data into a more standard format that was easier to read.</p>

<p>The next phase of exploartion involved looking at characteristics of popular songs.</p>
<p>The next phase of exploration involved looking at characteristics of popular songs. <br> I started by looking at the correlation between song popularity and playlist appearances. For the sake of this exploration, a song with a popularity score of 75 or higher is considered “popular.”</p>
<p><img src="Playlist Appearance vs Popularity.png" class="img-fluid"> The data showed there is little correlation between how popular a song is and the number of playlist appearances. <br> The song <em>Champions</em> by Kanye West had the <strong>most playlist appearances</strong> but only had a popularity rating of <strong>68</strong>.<br>
Additionally, <em>Goosebumps</em> by Travis Scott had the <strong>highest popularity score (92)</strong> but only appeared in <strong>410 playlists</strong>. <br> <br> Looking at the years when the most popular songs were released, the chart below shows that <strong>2017 had the highest number of popular songs released in a single year</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="Green Popular Songs by year.png" class="img-fluid"> <br> Next, I looked at the <strong>danceability</strong> of the songs in this dataset.</p>
<p><img src="Green Danceability by year.png" class="img-fluid"> Danceability peaked in <strong>2017</strong>. <br> <br> As for the different decades represented:</p>
<p><img src="Decades Represented.png" class="img-fluid"> <strong>Songs from the 2010s</strong> were the most frequently included in playlists. <br> <br> The <strong>frequency of musical keys</strong> is also important when it comes to popular songs.</p>
<p><img src="frequency of musical Keys.png" class="img-fluid"> Songs in <strong>Key 1 and Key 7</strong> were the most frequent in these playlists. <br> <br> As for track length:</p>
<p><img src="Track Length.png" class="img-fluid"> The most popular tracks are between <strong>3–5 minutes long</strong></p>
<p><img src="Average Track popularity by length.png" class="img-fluid"> and have an average popularity score of <strong>64.4</strong>. <br> <br> Knowing which artists have the most songs that are considered “popular” is important as well.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-the-playlist"><strong>Building the Playlist</strong></h2>
<p>Now that I’ve explored the data and evaluated the different properties of popular songs in these playlists, it’s time to start crafting the playlist. I began by choosing two anchor songs: <strong>“Closer” by The Chainsmokers</strong> and <strong>“YOUTH” by Troye Sivan</strong>.<br>
<br></p>
<p><em>Why these songs?</em><br>
They remind me of the first warm days of spring—when all you want to do is be outside, hanging out in the sun, listening to chill music. <br> Of rolling the windows down, driving to the beach to meet up with friends. <br> <strong>Of just having a good time</strong>. <br> <br> I started the curation by looking at songs that appeared on the same playlists as these two.</p>
<p>I also identified artists that frequently appeared on those playlists and made note of them to assist in filtering. <br> Next, I looked at the release years. <br> <br> “Closer” and “YOUTH” were released in <strong>2016 and 2015</strong>, respecitvely. I’ve always had a soft spot for songs from those years-so this became the first filter for the platlist. <br> <br> After filtering down to songs from <strong>2015 and 2016</strong>, I focused on tempo: <br> “Closer” has a tempo of <strong>95 BPM</strong>, and “YOUTH” is <strong>91.5 BPM</strong>. To maintain a consistent vibe, I filtered for songs with tempos between 90 and 110 BPM. <br> <br> Then I examined <strong>danceability</strong>. <br> Both songs have danceability scores between <strong>0.62</strong> and <strong>0.75</strong>, so I filtered down to songs with a danceability score <strong>above 0.6</strong>.</p>
<p>This process gave me a list of about 28 artists.</p>

<p><br> To narrow it down further, I filtered by <strong>acousticness</strong>. <br> “Closer” has an acousticness score of <strong>0.414</strong>, and “YOUTH” is <strong>0.0625</strong>. <br> To match the energy and feel of those tracks, I filtered for songs with acousticness <strong>at or below 0.42</strong>. <br> <br> Most of these tracks fall under <strong>pop, dance, or house</strong> genres. <br> As a final step, I excluded artists that didn’t match this vibe—such as <strong>Chris Brown</strong> or <strong>Zac Brown Band</strong>.</p>
