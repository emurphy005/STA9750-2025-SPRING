    "text": "Policy II: Increasing Staffing to Reduce Overtime Expenses\nWhen analyzing the data of the employee overtime pay of New York City, it quickly comes apparent that there are certain positions and agencies that accumulate more overtime hours than others. This second policy suggested the solution for this is to hire more full time employees to cover those extra hours, which will reduce the extra overtime costs.\nFor the sake of this analysis it it assummed that overtime pay is 1.5x the employee’s base pay and that the standard work week for all employees is 37.5 (7.5 hours a day). The average hourly rate was calculated for all employees, including those who are salaried or have a day rate.\nThrough inital exploration, at the agency level, the Police Department, Fire Department, and Department of Corrections have the positions that utilize the most overtime. The specific jobs positions accumulating the most overtime are:\n\n\n\nPolice Department\nFire Department\nDepartment of Corrections\n\n\n\n\nPolice Officer\nFireFighter\nCorrenction Officer\n\n\nSergeant\nLieutenant\nSanitation Worker\n\n\nLieutenant\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is reccommend that the city look to hire additional staff in these positions to lower the amount of overtime hours that are accrued in these positions.\n If the city were to hire additional fulltime employees to cover all the overtime hours that were accumulated over the past 10 years, they would need to hire 202,462 more full time employees. Below outlines the total savings per agency, as well as the amount of additional full time employees needed to cover the overtime hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This would have saved the city $7,452,570,913."

Using the savings from not having to hire new employees to replacce those who have quit, each agency could reward employees for the amount of time they stay at their job/within the job network covered by the New York City payroll system. For example, employees could recieve bonuses for staying 3.5 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and so on. This would not only help employee retention but also keep the money the City has within their budgets and not spent on new hire materials."

There are 19 states omitted from the NTD Service data.\nThis was the first year that awards were broken into categories by size. The size of the agency was determined by looking at the total UPT of that agency  The ranges for the categories are:\nSmall: 7,343 - 152,982 UPT\nMedium: 1,690,548 - 14,469,285 UPT\nLarge: 14,715,363 - 21,056,024,352 UPT\nSources: https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/usdot-announces-new-vehicle-fuel-economy-standards-model-year-2024-2026\nhttps://www.azocleantech.com"
