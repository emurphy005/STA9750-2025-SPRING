    "text": "Policy II: Increasing Staffing to Reduce Overtime Expenses\nWhen analyzing the data of the employee overtime pay of New York City, it quickly comes apparent that there are certain positions and agencies that accumulate more overtime hours than others. This second policy suggested the solution for this is to hire more full time employees to cover those extra hours, which will reduce the extra overtime costs.\nFor the sake of this analysis it it assummed that overtime pay is 1.5x the employee’s base pay and that the standard work week for all employees is 37.5 (7.5 hours a day). The average hourly rate was calculated for all employees, including those who are salaried or have a day rate.\nThrough inital exploration, at the agency level, the Police Department, Fire Department, and Department of Corrections have the positions that utilize the most overtime. The specific jobs positions accumulating the most overtime are:\n\n\n\nPolice Department\nFire Department\nDepartment of Corrections\n\n\n\n\nPolice Officer\nFireFighter\nCorrenction Officer\n\n\nSergeant\nLieutenant\nSanitation Worker\n\n\nLieutenant\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is reccommend that the city look to hire additional staff in these positions to lower the amount of overtime hours that are accrued in these positions.\n If the city were to hire additional fulltime employees to cover all the overtime hours that were accumulated over the past 10 years, they would need to hire 202,462 more full time employees. Below outlines the total savings per agency, as well as the amount of additional full time employees needed to cover the overtime hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This would have saved the city $7,452,570,913."

Using the savings from not having to hire new employees to replacce those who have quit, each agency could reward employees for the amount of time they stay at their job/within the job network covered by the New York City payroll system. For example, employees could recieve bonuses for staying 3.5 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and so on. This would not only help employee retention but also keep the money the City has within their budgets and not spent on new hire materials."

The song Champions by Kanye West had the most playlist appearances but only had a popularity rating of 68.\nAdditionally, Goosebumps by Travis Scott had the highest popularity score (92) but only appeared in 410 playlists.   Looking at the years when the most popular songs were released, the chart below shows that 2017 had the highest number of popular songs released in a single year.\n  Next, I looked at the danceability of the songs in this dataset.\n Danceability peaked in 2017.   As for the different decades represented:\n Songs from the 2010s were the most frequently included in playlists.   The frequency of musical keys is also important when it comes to popular songs.\n Songs in Key 1 and Key 7 were the most frequent in these playlists.

I began by choosing two anchor songs: “Closer” by The Chainsmokers and “YOUTH” by Troye Sivan.\n\nWhy these songs?\nThey remind me of the first warm days of spring—when all you want to do is be outside, hanging out in the sun, listening to chill music.  Of rolling the windows down, driving to the beach to meet up with friends.  Of just having a good time.   I started the curation by looking at songs that appeared on the same playlists as these two.\nI also identified artists that frequently appeared on those playlists and made note of them to assist in filtering.  Next, I looked at the release years.   “Closer” and “YOUTH” were released in 2016 and 2015, respecitvely. I’ve always had a soft spot for songs from those years-so this became the first filter for the platlist.   After filtering down to songs from 2015 and 2016, I focused on tempo:  “Closer” has a tempo of 95 BPM, and “YOUTH” is 91.5 BPM. To maintain a consistent vibe, I filtered for songs with tempos between 90 and 110 BPM.   Then I examined danceability.  Both songs have danceability scores between 0.62 and 0.75, so I filtered down to songs with a danceability score above 0.6.\nThis process gave me a list of about 28 artists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To narrow it down further, I filtered by acousticness.  “Closer” has an acousticness score of 0.414, and “YOUTH” is 0.0625.  To match the energy and feel of those tracks, I filtered for songs with acousticness at or below 0.42.   Most of these tracks fall under pop, dance, or house genres.  As a final step, I excluded artists that didn’t match this vibe—such as Chris Brown or Zac Brown Band.\nThis filtering process resulted in my final playlist of 16 songs, titled…"
