<h1><strong><em>The Ask:</em></strong></h1>
<p>New York City’s Commission to Analyze Taxpayer Spending (CATS) has tasked our team to help the Commmissioners indentify efficiencies and new opportunites for spending taypayer money through the analysis of City payroll data. This will be done through the analysis of the payscales, salary caps, and rentention rates to see how changes in any of these areas can help the City spend money more effiently.</p>
</section>
<section id="background-inital-exploration" class="level1">
<h1><strong><em>Background &amp; Inital Exploration:</em></strong></h1>
<p>In order to analyze the City payroll data, the first step is to ingest the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/about_data">Citywide Payroll Data</a> and perform some inital clean-up and analysis of the data to understand what is included.</p>

<p>Above is a snap shot of the first 25 rows. However, overall there are a total of 6.22 million entries (rows) that capture 17 different categories (columns), spaning across ten years (2014-2024). The columns include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal Year</li>
<li>First and Last Name</li>
<li>Title Description</li>
<li>Agency Name</li>
<li>Job Location</li>
</ul>
<p>The data shows that New York City pays its employees in three different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>per Annum - employees who are paid a salary</li>
<li>per Day - employees who are paid a day rate</li>
<li>per Hour - employees who are paid per hour they work</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the data provided, employees are eligible for overtime pay for hours worked in addition to their contract hours. Overtime pay plus their base paid and any other compensation (including bonuses) results in their <strong><em>Total Compensation</em></strong>. An example is shown in the below chart (first 25 rows shown).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="policy-ii-increasing-staffing-to-reduce-overtime-expenses"><em>Policy II: Increasing Staffing to Reduce Overtime Expenses</em></h2>
<p>When analyzing the data of the employee overtime pay of New York City, it quickly comes apparent that there are certain positions and agencies that accumulate more overtime hours than others. This second policy suggested the solution for this is to hire more full time employees to cover those extra hours, which will reduce the extra overtime costs.</p>
<p>For the sake of this analysis it it assummed that overtime pay is 1.5x the employee’s base pay and that the standard work week for all employees is 37.5 (7.5 hours a day). The average hourly rate was calculated for all employees, including those who are salaried or have a day rate.</p>
<p>Through inital exploration, at the agency level, the Police Department, Fire Department, and Department of Corrections have the positions that utilize the most overtime. The specific jobs positions accumulating the most overtime are:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Police Department</th>
<th>Fire Department</th>
<th>Department of Corrections</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Police Officer</td>
<td>FireFighter</td>
<td>Correnction Officer</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Sergeant</td>
<td>Lieutenant</td>
<td>Sanitation Worker</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Lieutenant</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It is reccommend that the city look to hire additional staff in these positions to lower the amount of overtime hours that are accrued in these positions.</p>
<p><br> If the city were to hire additional fulltime employees to cover <strong><em>all</em></strong> the overtime hours that were accumulated over the past 10 years, they would need to hire <strong>202,462</strong> more full time employees. Below outlines the total savings per agency, as well as the amount of additional full time employees needed to cover the overtime hours.</p>

<p><br> A way that the city could promote employee retention is to implement a tiered bonus system. Using the savings from not having to hire new employees to replacce those who have quit, each agency could reward employees for the amount of time they stay at their job/within the job network covered by the New York City payroll system. For example, employees could recieve bonuses for staying 3.5 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and so on. This would not only help employee retention but also keep the money the City has within their budgets and not spent on new hire materials.</p>

<h1><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></h1>
<p>If implemented, all three policies in this report can have a significant impact on the effiency of the New York City payroll. Having a more effiecnt payroll would allow for millions of dollars in savings that could be redistributed to other areas that have had their budgets cut, such as the New York Public Libray, the Parks Department and CUNY. These groups have had to cut programs and limit spending due to the lack of funding from the City, which is at the detriment of the citizens of New York City who rely on their services. It is the duty of the New York City government to make sure they are spending money appropriately and trying to find ways to save and reallocate these savings when they can.</p>
